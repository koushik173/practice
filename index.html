            <p>I am a positive, enthusiastic and competent Web Developer who, over the years, has built up a diverse range of skills, qualities and attributes that guarantee I will perform highly in this role.

            <h3 class="orangeHighLight">2020-2021 | Learner</h3>
            <p>My passion to work as a web developer was fuelled when I was tasked with editing the HTML of a word press blog during my internship. I fell in love with front-end development. Also, being frustrated by the functionality of the companyâ€™s website made me desire to become a full-stack developer. My love for coding has grown over the years and I have gained enough skills to solve even complex issues in the industry. I believe that working in your company will also give me more challenges to become better in this industry.
